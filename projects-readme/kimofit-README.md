- The entire app, including the onboarding screen, is fully localized, supporting both English and Arabic.
- Users can switch between languages at any time, and the motivational statements will update to reflect the chosen language.
  
This quick and engaging onboarding helps users get inspired and ready to start their fitness journey.
