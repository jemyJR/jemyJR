     - When the timer reaches zero, a "Time Up" message is shown, and users can click the checkmark icon to return to the timer options.
### Workout Sections
Beneath the timer and calendar widget, the workout screen is divided into several sections:

2. **Workout Exercises:** Main workout section.
3. **Abs Exercises:** Focused on abdominal exercises.
