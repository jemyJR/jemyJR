## Onboarding Screen

KimoFit includes a simple onboarding experience that consists of a single screen with motivational statements to inspire users. This screen is displayed when the app is first launched and remains visible until the **Get Started** button is clicked, after which it will not appear again.


- The entire app, including the onboarding screen, is fully localized, supporting both English and Arabic.
- Users can switch between languages at any time, and the motivational statements will update to reflect the chosen language.
  
This quick and engaging onboarding helps users get inspired and ready to start their fitness journey.

## Signup and Login Screens

KimoFit provides secure and user-friendly Signup and Login screens with built-in validation to ensure accurate and safe data entry. Key features include:



- **Single Device Access:** Each account is tied to the device it was created on. Users can only log in to their account on the device they initially signed up with, preventing access from multiple devices.
- **Validation:** Both the signup and login forms include validation for fields such as phone, password, and other required information to ensure proper input.

  
This ensures secure access and a smooth onboarding experience for each user.
