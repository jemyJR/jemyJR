- The entire app, including the onboarding screen, is fully localized, supporting both English and Arabic.
- Users can switch between languages at any time, and the motivational statements will update to reflect the chosen language.
  
This quick and engaging onboarding helps users get inspired and ready to start their fitness journey.

## Signup and Login Screens

KimoFit provides secure and user-friendly Signup and Login screens with built-in validation to ensure accurate and safe data entry. Key features include:



- **Single Device Access:** Each account is tied to the device it was created on. Users can only log in to their account on the device they initially signed up with, preventing access from multiple devices.
- **Validation:** Both the signup and login forms include validation for fields such as phone, password, and other required information to ensure proper input.

  
This ensures secure access and a smooth onboarding experience for each user.

## Home Screen

The KimoFit home screen provides a range of features for users:

- **Profile and Indicator:** Users can navigate to their profile page, and the start and end dates of their subscription are displayed with an indicator.
- **Sponsors Slider:** Displays a rotating set of sponsors.
- **Categories:** These navigate to different sections such as warmup, workout, diet, etc.
- **Contacts**: Shows the coach's social media links for quick access.
- **Pull to Refresh:** Users can pull down to refresh the home screen, and a shimmer widget appears while data is loading from the API.

### Client Types and Subscriptions
1.  **Paid Clients:** Can choose subscription plans of 1, 2, 3, or more months, giving them full access to all features and sponsors.
2. **Normal Clients:** Have an 8-day trial period with access to the workout program only, while other features remain locked. Clicking on locked categories navigates to the subscription screen, displaying a message: _"This feature is available to subscribed users only. Please upgrade your account by contacting us to enjoy all the features."_

### End of Subscription
- When a client's subscription ends (both paid and normal clients), a widget is displayed with the message: _"You have reached the end of your subscription!! Please renew your subscription to continue using the app."_
- This widget also contains Logout and Contact Me buttons to guide users toward renewing their subscription or contacting the coach for assistance.

### Special Category: Food Recipe Book
- This category requires an additional fee and is locked for both paid and normal clients by default. It is highlighted in gold.
- It is unlocked only after the additional fee is paid, and the coach can grant access to this feature.


This structure ensures a clear, consistent experience for both client types and provides easy access to subscription renewal options.
